rune_panel_text: 'Kleptomancy grants you additional bonus gold on hit against champions after using an ability. This is mostly useful against tanks to gain an advantage in lane without the need to kill them or get an early lead against other carries while relying on your scaling to compensate for the lack of a keystone later in the game.'
