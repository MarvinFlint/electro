  Due to needing **three separate attacks** this is harder to proc reliably than you'd think. Enhanced w-aa + w-active will not suffice and you will need to get one additional attack in which might turn out problematic against some ranged matchups.  
  While being insignificant early, the damage ramps and adds up over time, especially if you can get the bonus damage constantly. 
  
  While you want to trigger this basically off cooldown there are situations (e.g. looking for an all-in or your jungle wants to dive) you might want to hold onto it for bigger burst when you need it.  
  Also, don't be too greedy for the proc itself when trading. It is better to take free trades without retaliation than getting slightly more damage in but taking damage yourself.

  Electrocute scales with adaptive force. This means  that if you can trigger this on a squishy target in mid or lategame teamfights your assassination-potential is increased significantly at the cost of more utility in form of other keystones.  
  The most effective way to do so is by flanking the enemy carries, either by utilizing vision or teleporting behind them. This is especially true when playing against teams with strong peel in form of slows, such as [Thresh's ultimate](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Thresh#The_Box)
