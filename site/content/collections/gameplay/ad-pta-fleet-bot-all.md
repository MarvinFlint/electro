  Kennen's early laningphase against most other popular marksman botlane is relatively weak. You should only look to trade if you have your w-empowered basic attack available or if you can land a free q.  
  If you plan to trade proactively make sure you know when to use your E. In extended trades it is better used up front to make use of the attackspeed boost it provides while in shorter trades you might want to save it as an escape to avoid retaliation or dodge skillshots.  
  This also is your only means of escape so be sure you have full information before going in.
  
  Once you hit level 6 your killpotential increases significantly due to the cc and damage your ult can provide early. This is amplified if you team up with another strong lane support such as Leona, Pyke or Thresh which can provide the means to engage a fight.

  Your job as AD doesn't really differ from other traditional marksmen but you have some unique tools that help you do that job, namely your passive and ultimate. You have the ability to self-peel even multiple backline divers yourself or 1v1 singled out enemy carries with your utility or lock them down until your team arrives.  
  
  In trade your range isn't very long and without AP your abilities (except the w-onhit) won't rly do any damage so you should only use them if you need the cc in this specific instance and instead rely on your autoattacks for damage.
