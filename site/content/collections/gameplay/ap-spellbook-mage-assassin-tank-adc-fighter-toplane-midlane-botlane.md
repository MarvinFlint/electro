  Unsealed Spellbook gives you unmatched versatility and can be used both offensively and defensively depending on your needs. If you want to pressure your opponent ignite and exhaust can give you an edge in all-ins while heal and barrier can prevent you from dying. 
  
  Spellbook becomes active around the same time you hit level 6 and you shortly before you usually would take your first back. This is a really important timing because this allows you to recall, buy your items, teleport back to lane and then swap your teleport for ignite.  
  Now you should look for an all-in or look to invade with your jungler with your summoner advantage. You can adapt your choice depending on the situation and gain an edge on your opponent.

  One very important thing upfront: Don't override your teleport with a summoner spell you cannot get rid of quickly while splitpushing. Doing so essentially prevents you from using your teleport without any possibility of regaining it without fighting your opponent.
  
  In general your choices here should help you engage and / or survive against the enemy composition. Ghost can be a good help to get fights started, cleanse can nullify disengaging cc such as Sejuani R or Ashe R and Barrier/Heal will prevent your untimely demise when standing in the middle of the enemy team.
