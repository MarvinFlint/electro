  You should look to gain as big of a lead as you can possibly get in the early levels and after first back. These are arguably your strongest points in lane and you need to snowball from there to stay stronger than your opponent. 
  
  The easiest way to bully melees is by pushing them under the tower and harassing them while they try to get cs. While doing this you need to watch out for jungle ganks and thus cover your flank with wards, especially pink wards because you will push them in all the time. 
  
  Alternatively you can, provided your lead / relative strength is bg enough, freeze the lane in your third. This zones the enemy off of gold and exp as well putting them behind further but this is difficut to maintain unless your lead is enormous and also gives you less gold overall because you miss out on turret platings.
  
  Learning when to do what is core to playing toplane and veries from game to game and matchup to matchup.

  The playstyle you chose doesn't rly bring a lot to the table in full blown 5v5 teamfights which means you should usually avoid them. WHile situationally a flank tp can be useful, in general you just want to draw pressure into a sidelane and create an advantageous situations for your team on the other side of the map.
  
  Provided you kept your lead from laningphase you should be able to pressure most melee tops against their tower. The same rules apply again where you need vision in the enemy territory to avoid getting collapsed on.
