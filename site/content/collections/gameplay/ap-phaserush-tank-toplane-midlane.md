  Against tanks your primary choice should always be Kleptomancy unless the enemy team is **very** heavy stacked with slows (such as Thresh, Sejuani) or you want to be extra safe that you won't die to jungle ganks.
  
  This rune will keep you safe in lane for the most part and not be of much use otherwise. Tanks will rarely try to engage on you unless the enemy jungler is present and chasing them is mostly futile anyways.

  Phase Rush provides you with excellent teamfight mobility and makes it very hard to peel you. Protobelt counts as an attack for the purpose of Phase Rush which means Protobelt - R - W will give you basically instant slowimmunity for every teamfight.  
  Either use it to disengage after you used all your spells or chase after escaping enemies if necessary. Remember that everyother hard cc still disables you, essentially wasting your Keystone.
