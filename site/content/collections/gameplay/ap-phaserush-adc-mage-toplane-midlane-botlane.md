  Ranged matchups rarely give you the opportunity to use Phase Rush in lane outside of all-ins. And this is where it shines.  
  You can use the speedboost to stay in range of opponents even if they flash away or try to get rid of you with some form of cc/mobility such as Vayne's condemn or Lucian's Relentless Pursuit.

  Phase Rush provides you with excellent teamfight mobility and makes it very hard to peel you. Protobelt counts as an attack for the purpose of Phase Rush which means Protobelt - R - W will give you basically instant slowimmunity for every teamfight.  
  Either use it to disengage after you used all your spells or chase after escaping enemies if necessary. Remember that everyother hard cc still disables you, essentially wasting your Keystone.
