  Klepto has no real value in teamfights itself hence this section will talk about some items in detail.
  
  Basically all elixirs are insanely strong early on, especially before your first back. Don't forget to use them before starting a fight. The AP-elixir will also allow you to push towers really fast for a short duration due to the true-damage proc. Also, Travel size elixir of iron will instantly grant you hp, potentially saving your life.
  
  Considering you will push most of the time, free wards can help you cover your back.  
  
  Elixir of skill actually isn't as valuable as most of Kennen's damage lies in his high ap-ratios and not in his base damage. It is a nice-to-have regardless.
