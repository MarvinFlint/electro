lane_text: 'Against the more squishy representatives of this class like Gangplank or Riven this rune can give you the edge you need in lane to get ahead early. You should look to proc it as often as you possibly can, starting level 1 when most melees have no real way of fighting back.'

  Electrocute scales with adaptive force. This means that if you can trigger this on a squishy target in mid or lategame teamfights your assassination-potential is increased significantly at the cost of more utility in form of other keystones.  
  The most effective way to do so is by flanking the enemy carries, either by utilizing vision or teleporting behind them. This is especially true when playing against teams with strong peel in form of slows, such as [Thresh's ultimate](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Thresh#The_Box)
