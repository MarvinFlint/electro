  You chose a pretty bad pick, not gonna lie. Agaianst these types of champions it will be hard or even impossible to gain any sort of advantage unless they make massive mistakes during the laningphase.
  
  If you have to play this you should mostly look to farm efficiently and look for all-ins around your itemspikes. You also need to massively adapt your build in these situations to stay ahead of the curve - rush wits end against mages so they don't bully you out of lane and early health / resistances against assassins to be able to match them in all-ins. Against other marksmen, namely Lucian / Vayne get early tabis and ask your jungler to help you gain an early lead which you can snowball off of.

  While less effective than against melees, AD-onhit Kennen still is an excellent duellist that can take mages and other adcs 1v1 pretty confidently. 
  
  The rules are the same as against fighters and tanks - shove in the wave and pressure the towers to create advantageous situations on the other side of the map while covering your flanks to prevent getting collapsed on.
