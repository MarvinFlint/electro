  This is more risky than tanks but still doable if you want to. You'll need to be more careful with when you use your abilities as bruisers can usually punish you for wasting abilities (especially your escape) and your turnout will generally be lower than when playing against a tank.
  
  When using Kleptomancy against a bruiser you'll need to use the early lead you get by using your itemadvantage at key points in the lane or smat use of the elixirs to surprise your opponent. Be aware that the lack of utility (such as Phase Rush or Spellbook) leaves you vulnerable to all-ins and jungle ganks which you will constantly provoke by using your kleptomancy stacks, so keep your vision up.

  Klepto has no real value in teamfights itself hence this section will talk about some items in detail.
  
  Basically all elixirs are insanely strong early on, especially before your first back. Don't forget to use them before starting a fight. The AP-elixir will also allow you to push towers really fast for a short duration due to the true-damage proc. Also, Travel size elixir of iron will instantly grant you hp, potentially saving your life.
  
  Considering you will push most of the time, free wards can help you cover your back.  
  
  Elixir of skill actually isn't as valuable as most of Kennen's damage lies in his high ap-ratios and not in his base damage. It is a nice-to-have regardless.
