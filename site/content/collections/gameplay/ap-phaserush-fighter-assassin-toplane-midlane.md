  For these matchups Phase Rush can be crucial to ensure your survival. Assassins and Bruisers usually have high mobility and at least some form of soft cc. Kennen's base stats are very low and he won't last long in close quarters combat so it is essential to keep your distance - and match their mobility.  
  The simplest way to get a PR proc is one basic attack + e + w and will get you out of most trouble such as a Jax or Irelia jumping you.  
  This can also be used to avoid otherwise lethal jungle ganks by using the jungler itself as an escape route with q - w - e (in case he is coming from behind)

  Phase Rush provides you with excellent teamfight mobility and makes it very hard to peel you. Protobelt counts as an attack for the purpose of Phase Rush which means Protobelt - R - W will give you basically instant slowimmunity for every teamfight.  
  Either use it to disengage after you used all your spells or chase after escaping enemies if necessary. Remember that everyother hard cc still disables you, essentially wasting your Keystone.
