  You should look to abuse your keystone as much as possible - tanks are as easy as it gets to use your stacks as they usually lack the means of fighting back.  
  Using abilities while your attack-projectile is mid-flight will still cause this attack to apply kleptomancy, so make use of this by using either Q or E after your attack has launched. Beware that you will use up your escape if you use e and that you will draw minion-aggro when attack enemy champions. To get rid of it dip in and out of bushes.  
  You'll have the easiest time doing this when the enemy is pushed under their tower when they'll be busy trying to lasthit instead of retaliating but be aware of the possiblity of getting ganked at all times.

  Klepto has no real value in teamfights itself hence this section will talk about some items in detail.
  
  Basically all elixirs are insanely strong early on, especially before your first back. Don't forget to use them before starting a fight. The AP-elixir will also allow you to push towers really fast for a short duration due to the true-damage proc. Also, Travel size elixir of iron will instantly grant you hp, potentially saving your life.
  
  Considering you will push most of the time, free wards can help you cover your back.  
  
  Elixir of skill actually isn't as valuable as most of Kennen's damage lies in his high ap-ratios and not in his base damage. It is a nice-to-have regardless.
